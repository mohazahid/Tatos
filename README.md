## Brief
Tatos is a 2D top down thriller game where you have to find and collect potatoes in a map. As you are collecting the potatoes, the corrupt potato will be chasing you down and you have to avoid him. If he gets too close, you can stun him by throwing a rock in his direction. If you want to see better, you must find the lantern. You must find all 8 potatoes before the corrupt potato gets you to win the game. Explore, collect, avoid, and win the game.
